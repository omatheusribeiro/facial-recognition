# Face Recognition System

This repository contains a system for facial expression recognition, facial recognition, and age estimation implemented in JavaScript using the face-api library.

## Description

The aim of this project is to demonstrate the usage of the face-api library to perform facial expression recognition, facial recognition, and age estimation in images or videos. face-api is a powerful open-source JavaScript library that allows real-time face detection and analysis.

## Features

The system offers the following features:

- Face Detection: Identifies and locates faces in images or videos.
  
- Facial Expression Recognition: Recognizes and categorizes the facial expressions of detected faces into categories such as joy, sadness, surprise, anger, and more.
