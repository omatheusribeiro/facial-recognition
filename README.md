# 🤖 Facial Recognition System

## 📌 Overview
The **Facial Recognition** project is a powerful system designed to detect facial expressions, recognize faces, and estimate age using the **face-api** library. 🚀

This repository contains an implementation of:

✅ **Facial Expression Recognition** 😊😡😢  
✅ **Facial Recognition** 🧑🔍  
✅ **Age Estimation** 🎯

## 📝 Description
The aim of this project is to demonstrate the usage of the **face-api** library to perform facial expression recognition, facial recognition, and age estimation in images or videos. **face-api** is an open-source JavaScript library that enables real-time face detection and analysis.
